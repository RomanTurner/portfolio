      I am a JavaScript and Sushi enthusiast with a soft spot for Ruby and
      Musubi. I derive purpose from creation and I have a passion for making
      tools that can make your life easier. I am a community builder with ten
      years of experience working with small teams in production. I believe
      everyone has a unique skill or vision and I love seeing it piece together.
